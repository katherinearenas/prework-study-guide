        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is how we build the structure of the site.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content, words, images, and videos shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The title element tells the end user's browser what the page title is. This is important for SEO.</li>
          <li>The meta element tells the end user's browser information about the webpage, like the language, character encoding, and default view.</li>
          <li>The body element is a parent element. Other elements nested inside of the body are children of the body.</li>
          <li>Some of these create links to other pages,reference images, or list items, etc.</li>
          <li>There are six headers h1-h6</li>

        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>Borders can be any of the colors in the HTML color code, or coded by simple name, like grey, or blue, or purple.</li>
            <li>HTML elements can be used as class selectors when writing in CSS, but, a class selector can be attributed to any html element we might choose.</li>
            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.</li>
            <li>Separation of concerns is a coding principle that indicates best practice is to use external CSS, because it makes design changes easier without having to make any changes to the html structure of the page.</li>
            <li>Do not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developer to reuse shared pieces of code. In this prework study guide the header and footer share colors, width, and height.</li>
            <li>Text align is a positioning property, i.e. left, right, center, and justify.</li>
            <li>The Image selector assigns properties to any images in the html markup.
            <li> CSS stylesheets must be linked to the HTML document

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is version control software.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout main: switches to main branch</li>
          <li>git checout -d brance-name: deletes branch</li>
          <LI>There are a variety of additional commands, but these are the most important ones for this study guide. Additional commands can be found in the git cheatsheet.</LI>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud hosting service web developers use to store projects in repositories that can be accessed by a team of developers.</li>
          <li>A repo is the nickname for a repository.</li>
          <li>When creating a repository, we must name it and select a license. In this course we use the MIT License.</li>
          <li>An issue helps up track which allow us to break down our projects into separate manageable tasks.</li>
          <li>A branch is a version of the repsitory. The main branch is the default branch created when the repository is made.</li>
          <li>A feature branch is a way developers can work on an aspect of the code without affecting the main branch. Code can be pushed to the main branch when it is complete.</li>
          <li>A commit is a change made to a file within the repo.</li>
          <li>A pull request is how we pull changes made in a commit into another branch, often the main branch. It allows multiple users to comment on the changes before it is finalized with a merge.</li>
          <li>A merge is what happens when a pull request is approved.</li>
          <li>We can close issues once we have achieved the goals we set to complete the tasks.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A variable can be changed within the code by changing it's value.</li>
          <li>A string is a list of possible values for a variable. We created a string in java consisting of our topics for this study guide.</li>
          <li>Console.log is a method of creating an output message in the Console of our browser.</li>
          <li>A JavaScript file must be linked to the html file in order to run, just like the CSS file.</li>
          <li>We always link JavaScript at the bottom of the code so it is applied to the entirety of the HTML file. If java loads first there is nothing to apply it to and the code will not work.</li>
          <li>We can use Chrome DevTools to check our work in the console with the console.log method.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and for loops "(i.e. if and for)" to control the order in which the code executes.</li>
          <li>Boolean type statements yield true or false results.</li>
          <li>Conditional statements can interrupet the control flow.</li>
          <li>An array allows us to execute each variable in a string without having to retype our code for each variant. It is a single variable usually containing a group of related data.</li>
          <li>A for loop can help us execute each value in an array without having to manually enter each item.</li>
          <li>The first statement in our for loop determines the starting point for our loop.</li>
          <li>A function is a building block of Java code, allowing us to produce a result when applied to our code.</li>
          <li>Math is a Java built-in object, math.random and math.floor can be used together to call a random number.</li>
          <li>We're just starting to understand Java, more to come as we practice in class!</li>
